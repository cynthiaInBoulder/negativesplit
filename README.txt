This web app will calculate the halfway distance of an activity to determine if activity was a negative split.
Why negative split?
Could not find a calculator online that would analyze a gps file to determine if an activity was a negative split.

First implementation will upload a Garmin .tcx file and determine if negative split.

Added error handling. tcx files do not always contain distance data in last gps trackpoint

TODO: 
Add functionality for .gpx files
Add functionality to handle multisport files
Add functionality to upload 2 files for comparsion
Add graphing of the data to display available data
