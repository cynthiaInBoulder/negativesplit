            <h3> What is a negative split?</h3>
            
            <p>From wiki: A negative split or the action of negative splitting is a racing strategy that involves completing the second half of a race faster than the first half. It is defined by the intentional setting of a slower initial pace, followed by either a gradual or sudden increase of speed towards the end of a race.</p>

            <p><bold>ITEM OF NOTE:</bold> Most World Records in running have been negative splits. Optimal negative split is said to be 1% </p>
            
            <h3>Running data geekiness prompted this web app</h3>
            
            <p>I love data and I can't find any online calculators to analyze an activity - so here it goes.</p>
            
            <h3>Ease of use has been thwarted</h3>

            <p>The original plan was to access the Garmin Connect API.</p>
            
            <p>The app was going to have a form where you could enter your login for connect.garmin.com along with date and type of activity and the app would search for matching activities, display search results and then you would select the appropriate files.  How easy is that??</p>

            <p>Well - turns out Garmin has closed their open API and is now charging a $5000.00 license fee.  That was out of my price range for this little project - so for now (I'm searching for other options)you'll have to save the file from Garmin (or any .gpx file)to your computer of choice and upload from there.  Sorry!</p>
            
            <h3>What can I do better?</h3>
            
            <p>I've been a backend software engineer for over 4 years now.  I've studiously stayed away from the front end as there are SO many things to learn about Java/J2EE mid-tier/backend engineering</p>

            <p>This is my first attempt at any UI/Frontend design.  I'm sure there are ways to make this easier to use.  Or add more functionality.  I'm open to any suggestions<a href="mailto:negativesplitcalculator@gmail.com?Subject=NegativeSplitCalculator" target="_top"> - shoot me an email</a></p>
